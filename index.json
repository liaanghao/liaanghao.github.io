Focusing on international migration, I am interested in ethnic minority and immigrant integration and segregation, and sociological methodology focusing on sequence analysis, causal inference and social network analysis. Most of my work focuses on Japan and the United States. CV here.\nMy empirical work focuses on (1) causes and consequences of residential segregation in new destinations, (2) the effects of educational credentials and educational mobility in both traditional and new destinations, and (3) the effects of premigration selectivity on immigrant integration. I am interested in both between group and within group heterogeneity.\nMy methodological interests lie in (1) the effects of sequences on social outcomes combining sequence analysis and causal inference, and (2) the feature of social networks on segregation using agent-based modeling and simulation.\nFeel free to say hi to me via hl893@cornell.edu. I\u0026rsquo;d love to get to know about you!\n","date":"October 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" # My research broadly focuses on the social and structural processes and consequences that immigrants experience in host societies, including residential mobility and segregation, socioeconomic integration, selectivity and health outcomes, and family dynamics. # ","date":"October 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"research"},{"content":"","date":"October 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/seg287/","section":"","summary":"Using a quasi-experimental design comparing 287(g) and non-implementing counties, this paper shows that local immigration enforcement slowed declines in Latino-white segregation, especially in early-adopting Southern counties.","title":"Local deportation programs reinforced Latino segregation.","type":"research"},{"content":"","date":"December 15, 2024","externalUrl":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-025-09943-5","permalink":"/research/resiseg/","section":"","summary":"Using census microdata, this paper describes the trends of majority-minorty and minority-minority segregation and their associations with segregation theories in Japan from 2000 to 2020.","title":"Immigrants in Japan are pretty segregated.","type":"research"},{"content":"","date":"November 23, 2024","externalUrl":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01979183241305404","permalink":"/research/resimobi/","section":"","summary":"Using sequence analysis, this paper finds that residential mobility into and out of ethnic neighborhoods is associated with varying levels of socioeconomic resources and coethnic preferences.","title":"Chinese immigrants move back to Chinatowns for coethnic preferences.","type":"research"},{"content":"","date":"October 17, 2024","externalUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ssjj/jyaf001","permalink":"/research/whitecolar/","section":"","summary":"This paper shows that for immigrant labor, education in Japan does not lead to higher income levels after adjusting for various confounders, including university rankings and majors.","title":"Locally educated immigrant labor does not necessarily earn more in Japan.","type":"research"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
